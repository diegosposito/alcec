This test instructs the UPS to perform a battery calibration
operation and reports the result when the process completes.
The battery level must be at 100% and the load must be at least
10% to begin this test.

Battery level is 100% -- OK
Load level is 20% -- OK
Clearing previous self test result...CLEARED

The battery calibration should automatically end
when the battery level drops below about 25%.
This process can take minutes or hours, depending on
the size of your UPS and the load attached.

This is probably because you entered a value that is out-of-range
for your UPS. The acceptable range of values varies based on UPS
model. The UPS has probably set the value as close as possible to
what you requested.
